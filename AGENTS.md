## Project knowledge

This repository contains a **Grafana plugin**. You must Read @./.config/AGENTS/instructions.md before doing changes.

## Project goals

- Simple, clean, and maintainable code is the top priority.
- The current goal of this project is to support the Apache ECharts library as a panel plugin in Grafana
- This plugins should provide a simple user experience that aligns with core Grafana panels
- Grafana and EChart APIs should be isolated from each other whenever possible, preferably in different directories
- Any usage of Grafana or EChart APIs should contain links to the relevant documentation

## Critical rules

- Push back on the prompter when scope of work conflicts with project goals.
- Ask for permission and clarity whenever ambiguities arise.
- Keep plans small and focused to the task at hand, do not make changes that were not explicitly requested
- Add comments to code, but keep them as concise as possible
- Adhere to data plane frame specifications: https://grafana.com/developers/dataplane/, except when explicitly told not to
- Create provisioned dashboards for all new panel functionality, prompt the user to check existing dashboards that can be impacted by a change
